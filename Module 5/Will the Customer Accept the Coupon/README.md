### Problem Statement
Will a customer accept the coupon?

Consider a marketing campaign where drivers are sent coupons to their cell phone for a nearby dining establishment. We will answer the question of what factors impact whether a customer accepts the coupon.

### Approach

### Results
- In this analysis, we determined that the coupon type with the highest acceptance rate was Carry out & Take Away, at 73.8%.
- 80 degree weather will result in a slightly higher acceptance rate than 30 or 50.


### Recommendation
Takeout restaurants should target their coupons during days with nice weather, in the second half of the day. They should also target individuals with lower incomes and lower levels of educational attainment.
